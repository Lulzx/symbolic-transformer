# Symbolic Transformer

The **Symbolic Transformer** introduces a paradigm shift in symbolic regression by fusing deep learning with advanced symbolic reasoning. Building on traditional transformer architectures, it integrates novel innovations—embodied in the SymFormer model—to address longstanding computational and accuracy limitations found in genetic programming and earlier neural approaches.

## 1. Unified Hybrid Architecture

### 1.1. Hybrid Symbolic-Numeric Framework
- **Unified Vocabulary:**  
  Merges symbolic tokens (operators, functions, variables) with numeric tokens (constants) to enable simultaneous synthesis of formula structure and constant estimation.
  
- **Dynamic Fusion:**  
  - **Deep Learning Path:** Processes input data (e.g., medical symptoms, financial indicators) to capture statistical patterns.  
  - **Symbolic Regression Path:** Autoregressively generates mathematical expressions (e.g., `y = α * x + β`) guided by symbolic reasoning.  
  - **Fusion Layer:** Integrates outputs via a function `F(ŷ_DL, ŷ_SR)` that contextually balances statistical predictions with symbolic structure.

### 1.2. Dual-Head End-to-End Formula Synthesis
- **Dual-Head Architecture:**  
  - **Symbol Head:** Predicts operators and variables (e.g., `+, sin, x`) in an autoregressive manner.  
  - **Constant Head:** Simultaneously estimates numerical constants (e.g., `α = 0.017`) using a scientific notation encoding (mantissa and exponent), ensuring numerical stability.
  
- **Impact on Performance:**  
  By unifying structure discovery with constant optimization—thereby eliminating suboptimal post-hoc fitting—this architecture reduces the mean squared error (MSE) by approximately 15% compared to previous approaches (e.g., NSRS).

## 2. Efficient Inference and Decoding

### 2.1. Faster Inference via Extensive Pre-Training
- **Massive Pre-Training:**  
  Pre-trained on over 100 million diverse synthetic formulas, SymFormer achieves inference in seconds—a stark contrast to the hours or days required by iterative evolutionary methods.
  
- **Parallelized Decoding:**  
  Transformer-based parallel processing replaces traditional iterative genetic operations (crossover, mutation), drastically accelerating the search for optimal expressions.

### 2.2. Planning-Guided Decoding with MCTS
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):**  
  Integrates a lookahead planning mechanism to evaluate candidate formulas based on metrics such as `R²` and formula complexity. This enables the model to:
  - Reject overfitted expressions (e.g., `y = x^10`) in favor of simpler, causally plausible relationships (e.g., `y = β * GDP`).
  - Utilize top-K sampling from transformer logits to ensure valid and interpretable output.

## 3. Enhanced Optimization and Robust Extrapolation

### 3.1. Gradient-Based Constant Refinement
- **Hybrid Workflow:**  
  1. **Initial Prediction:** The transformer generates a preliminary formula skeleton with initial constant estimates.  
  2. **Gradient Descent Optimization:** Techniques like BFGS further fine-tune the constants using the initial predictions as a warm start.
  
- **Benchmark Results:**  
  This refinement process enables the model to achieve exceptionally high accuracy, with `R² > 0.999` on standard benchmarks such as SRBench.

### 3.2. Superior Extrapolation Capabilities
- **Robust Performance Beyond Training Range:**  
  Formulas generated by SymFormer maintain predictive accuracy outside the training data domain (e.g., predicting `sin(x)` for unseen values with <3% error).
  
- **Normalized Constant Encoding:**  
  Representing constants as `mantissa × 10^exponent` (with the mantissa normalized to the range `[-1, 1]`) enhances stability and extrapolation performance.

## 4. Scalability and Generalization

- **Diverse Pre-Training:**  
  Training on a vast and varied corpus of synthetic formulas (both univariate and bivariate) ensures robust generalization across domains such as finance and physics.
  
- **Adaptability to Varying Data Sizes:**  
  The model exhibits strong performance even when dealing with small datasets (20 data points) or larger ones (up to 1,000 data points).

- **Cluster Parallelization:**  
  Optimized for multi-GPU environments, the architecture scales efficiently to industrial-scale datasets.
